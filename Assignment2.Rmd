## R Markdown

This is an Assignment 2: R Markdown Presentation & Plotly for Developing Data 
Products course by John Hopkins University on Coursera. The goal of this assignment is to:

1. Create a web page presentation using R Markdown.
2. Web page presentation must contain a plot created with plotly.
3. Assignment should be hosted on GitHub Pages, RPubs, or NeoCities.

## Plot created with plotly

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)

my_plot <- plot_ly(iris, x = ~ Petal.Length, y = ~ Petal.Width, color = as.factor(iris$Species), type = "scatter", mode = "markers")
my_plot
```
